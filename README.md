### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Who am I?
My name is Asafe Matheus Moraes de Sousa. I was born on February 13th, 2003 in north of Brazil, I've moved to Santa Catarina when I was 13 years old, and when I was in high school I got interested in programming, so I learned python, which is the first language that I learned. Currently, I'm learning web development. 


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development especially backend.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the way that I write my code, I want it easy to understand. By the way, feel free to send a pull request at any project.
- ðŸ”Ž quick currently goal: be more active on Github and to implement clean code rules on my codes.
